Description: Miscellaneous functions, mostly tidyverse related.
  Set names, table names, or factor levels by function, regular expression,
  or with sequential numbering. Filter complete cases. A select helper function
  that uses globbing instead of regular expressions to select variables.
  Truncate or censor values in vectors. Flexible "between" function. log2 scales
  for ggplot2.
